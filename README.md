# *Skill Factory* Bootcamp
Welcome to my GitHub repository for *Avalith's bootcamp* named **Skill Factory** divided in two courses, one for React and other for Node. Here you will find my very first projects made in React and Node.js.
## *Fake Store API*
First *Back-end* project made in **Node.js** and **Express Js**. 
It's a back-end application that connects to the **Fake Store API**. Its main functionality is to connect via *endpoints* in a *router* to the API and get all the required information.
